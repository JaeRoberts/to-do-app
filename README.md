# to-do-app

The **To-Do App** is a mini project I was assigned during my design 
apprenticeship with Bloc that allowed me to exercise the JavaScript 
and jQuery knowledge I gained in the program by developing an interactive 
to-do web app and applying the Material Design Lite Library.

The objective of the project was to:
- Understand **DOM events** and how they enable interactive web pages and web apps
- Analyze and determine which events are most appropriate for the current situation
- Create and use custom **event listeners** and methods
- Recognize and use common ES6 features like `const`, `let`, and `=>` functions
- Understand concepts of **state** & **UI**
- Organize code in a logical, readable manner

###### After pressing ENTER or clicking ADD A NEW TASK, the `createNewToDo` function runs and populates the space below with the submitted list item.
